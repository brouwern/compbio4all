## Data matrix

Data matrix from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPGMA#First_step

One way to make the data is to rbind() individual vectors as rows

```{r}
# The data
#      a   b   c   d   e
a <- c(0,	 17, 21, 31, 23)
b <- c(17, 0,	 30, 34, 21)
c	<- c(21, 30, 0,  28, 39)
d	<- c(31, 34, 28,	0, 43)
e	<- c(23, 21, 39, 43,	0)

# Bind into a matrix
upgma.mat1 <- rbind(a,b,c,d,e)

```

Add names using colnames()
```{r}
colnames(upgma.mat1) <- c("a","b","c","d","e")
```

The matrix is symmetrical.  Its easier if you make redundant elements NA because we don't need them.

We can access the diagonal directly and set it to NA like this
```{r}
diag(upgma.mat1) <- NA
```

Its clunkier but we can set the rest of the matrix to NA like this.
```{r}
upgma.mat1[upper.tri(upgma.mat1)] <- NA
```

## Data frame to store stuff

it = iteration
clust.i, clust.j = the two taxa or clades being combined
dist.ij = value from distnace matrix between the taxa
clust.u = name of the new combined cluster (clade)
branch.l.ij = branch lengths 

```{r}
n.taxa <- nrow(upgma.mat1)
UPGMA_output <- data.frame(it = c(1:n.taxa),
                           clust.i = NA,
                           clust.j = NA,
                           dist.ij = NA,
                           clust.u = NA,
                           branch.l.ij = NA)
```


## Algorithm - First step

### Determine minimum value in current matrix

The minimum distance
```{r}
dist.min.i <- min(upgma.mat1, na.rm = T)
```

The index values of the minimum
```{r}
index.min.i <- which(upgma.mat1 == dist.min.i, arr.ind =T)
index.row.i <- index.min.i[1]
index.col.i <- index.min.i[2]
```

We can get the names of our taxa using the 
```{r}
cluster.i2 <- rownames(upgma.mat1)[index.row.i]
cluster.i1 <- colnames(upgma.mat1)[index.col.i]
```


Add output to dataframe
```{r}
UPGMA_output[1,"clust.i"] <- cluster.i1
UPGMA_output[1,"clust.j"] <- cluster.i2
UPGMA_output[1,"dist.ij"] <- dist.min.i
```


### Combine species into clade

Combine the two taxa names into a new name.  This can be done a couple ways.
```{r}
clade.i <- paste(cluster.i1,cluster.i2, sep = "")
```

We'll add this to the dataframe
```{r}
UPGMA_output[1,"clust.u"] <- clade.i
```


### First branch length estimation

Branch length is distance/2 or d.ij/2
```{r}
UPGMA_output[1,"branch.l.ij"] <- UPGMA_output[1,"dist.ij"]/2
```


### First distance matrix update

Distance (ab) to all other points
ab to c
ab to d
ab to e


#### ab to c


Using Swofford et al's notation:

d.ku = (Ti x d.ki + Tj x d.kj)/(Ti + Tj)

I'll switch the subscripts to be consistent with the Wikipedia notation

d.uk = (Ti x d.ik + Tj x d.jk)/(Ti + Tj)


where 

u = our new cluster ab
k = the remaining clusters; we'll start with c
Ti, Tj = the number of clusters the constitute the clusters that were just combined.  This starts out at 1.
Ti = Ta = 1
Tj = Tb = 1
d.ik = the distance from cluster i to the reamining clusters; we'll start with c
d.ik = d.ac = 21
d.jk = d.bc = 30

d.ku = (Ti x d.ik + Tj x d.jk)/(Ti + Tj)
d.ku = (1  x 21   +  1 x 30  )/( 1 + 1 )
d.ku = (  21      +    30  )/(2)
d.ku = 51/2
d.ku = 25.5

The Swofford notation is more generic and useful because in the next iteration we'll have a cluster of ab which will have two taxa in it.
```{r}
Ta <- 1
Tb <- 1
Da_c <- 21
Db_c <- 30
Dab_c <- (Ta*Da_c+Tb*Db_c)/2
```



#### ab to d

We now continue for the other distances.  I'll stick to the wikipedia notation for now.

D(ab to d) = [D(a to d) + D(b to d)] / 2
D(ab to d) = [    31    +     34   ] / 2
D(ab to d) = [    31    +     34   ] / 2
D(ab to d) = 32.5

Dab_d      = [Da_d + Db_d] / 2
Dab_d      = 32.5

```{r}
Ta <- 1
Tb <- 1
Da_d <- 31
Db_d <- 34
Dab_d <- (Ta*Da_d+Tb*Db_d)/2
```

#### ab to e


D(ab to d) = [D(a to d) + D(b to d)] / 2
D(ab to d) = [    23    +     21   ] / 2
D(ab to d) = [    23    +     21   ] / 2
D(ab to d) = Dab_e

Dab_d      = [Da_d + Db_d] / 2
Dab_d      = Dab_e

```{r}
Ta <- 1
Tb <- 1
Da_e <- 23
Db_e <- 21
Dab_e <- (Ta*Da_e+Tb*Db_e)/2

```

The distances are
```{r}
Dab_c
Dab_d
Dab_e
```


### Update matrix with new distance

Old matrix has distances  from a and b to all other points: we want to replace these.  distances among c, d, and e are still the same values.

```{r}
upgma.mat1
```

#### Illustration

Values in parenthesese will be REPLACED

```{r}
a <- c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
b <- c("(17)", NA, NA, NA, NA)
c	<- c("(21)", "(30)", NA, NA, NA)
d	<- c("(31)", "(34)", "28", NA, NA)
e	<- c("(23)", "(21)", "39", "43",	NA)
upgma.mat1.alt <- rbind(a,b,c,d,e)
colnames(upgma.mat1.alt) <- c("a","b","c","d","e")
upgma.mat1.alt
```

Create smaller matrix with clade ab
```{r}
#       ab      c   d   e
ab  <- c(NA,    NA,  NA, NA)
c	  <- c(Dab_c, NA,  NA, NA)
d	  <- c(Dab_d, 28,	 NA, NA)
e	  <- c(Dab_e, 39,  43, NA)

upgma.mat2 <- rbind(ab,c,d,e)
colnames(upgma.mat2) <- c("ab","c","d","e")

```




## Algorithm - Second step

We've combined a and b and calculated the disnace of this clade (a,b) to the remaining taxa.  What is now the minimum distance?


The minimum distance of the current matrix
```{r}
dist.min.i <- min(upgma.mat2, na.rm = T)
```

The index value of the current minimum
```{r}
index.min.i <- which(upgma.mat2 == dist.min.i, arr.ind =T)
index.row.i <- index.min.i[1]
index.col.i <- index.min.i[2]
```

We can get the names of our taxa using the 

```{r}
cluster.i2 <- rownames(upgma.mat2)[index.row.i]
cluster.i1 <- colnames(upgma.mat2)[index.col.i]
```


Add output to dataframe
```{r}
UPGMA_output[2,"clust.i"] <- cluster.i1
UPGMA_output[2,"clust.j"] <- cluster.i2
UPGMA_output[2,"dist.ij"] <- dist.min.i
```

### Combine species into clade

Combine the two taxa names into a new name.  This can be done a couple ways.
```{r}
clade.i <- paste(cluster.i1,cluster.i2, sep = "")
```

We'll add this to the dataframe

```{r}
UPGMA_output[2,"clust.u"] <- clade.i
```


### Calculate branch length

Branch length is distance/2 or d.ij/2 = d.ab.e = 22/2
```{r}
UPGMA_output[2,"branch.l.ij"] <- UPGMA_output[2,"dist.ij"]/2
```

### Recalculate distance from abe to all remainign taxa

In the current matrix, the smallest distance is between ab and e

We therefore want to form a clade between ab and e (abe), the measure the distance from this clade to allthe other species.


#### abe to c

NOTE: calculations are "weighted" in proportion number of species in clade.
So D(ab to c) is multiplied by two because ab is 2 species

The denominators is 3 because of the weights used in the numerator.

The notation in the Wikipedia article is:

D(abe to c) = [2*D(ab to c)*2  + 1*D(e to c)] / (2+1)
D(abe to c) = [    25.5*2    +     39*1   ] / (2+1)
D(abe to c) = [    25.5*2    +     39*1   ] / (2+1)
D(abe to c) = 32.5

Dabe_c      = [Dab_c*2 + De_c*1] / (2+1)
Dabe_c       = 32.5



```{r}
T.ab <- 2
T.e  <- 1
Dab_c <- 25.5
De_c  <- 39
Dabe_c <- (T.ab*Dab_c + T.e*De_c)/(T.ab+T.e)
```

#### abe to c

For abe to d

```{r}
T.ab <- 2
T.e  <- 1
Dab_d <- 32.5
De_d  <- 43
Dabe_d <- (T.ab*Dab_d + T.e*De_d)/(T.ab+T.e)

```


Distances
```{r}
Dabe_c
Dabe_d
```

### Update the matrix

```{r}
abe <- c(NA,     NA,  NA)
c	   <- c(Dabe_c, NA,  NA)
d	   <- c(Dabe_d, 28,	 NA)


upgma.mat3 <- rbind(abe,c,d)
colnames(upgma.mat3) <- c("abe","c","d")
```


## Third step

### Calculate branch lengths


The minimum distance of the current matrix
```{r}
dist.min.i <- min(upgma.mat3, na.rm = T)
```

The index value of the current minimum
```{r}
index.min.i <- which(upgma.mat3 == dist.min.i, arr.ind =T)
index.row.i <- index.min.i[1]
index.col.i <- index.min.i[2]
```

We can get the names of our taxa using the 

```{r}
cluster.i2 <- rownames(upgma.mat3)[index.row.i]
cluster.i1 <- colnames(upgma.mat3)[index.col.i]
```


Add output to dataframe
```{r}
UPGMA_output[3,"clust.i"] <- cluster.i1
UPGMA_output[3,"clust.j"] <- cluster.i2
UPGMA_output[3,"dist.ij"] <- dist.min.i
```

### Combine species into clade

Combine the two taxa names into a new name.  This can be done a couple ways.
```{r}
clade.i <- "cd"
clade.i <- paste("c","d",sep = "")

clade.i <- paste(cluster.i1,cluster.i2, sep = "")
```

We'll add this to the dataframe

```{r}
UPGMA_output[3,"clust.u"] <- clade.i
```


### Calculate branch length

Branch length is distance/2 or d.ij/2 = d.d.e = 28/2
```{r}
UPGMA_output[3,"branch.l.ij"] <- UPGMA_output[3,"dist.ij"]/2
```




### Distance of c to abe and d to abe

```{r}
T.c  <- 1
T.d  <- 1
Dc_abe <- 30
Dd_abe <- 36

Ddc_abe <- (T.c*Dc_abe + T.d*Dd_abe)/(T.c+T.d)


```

Create matrix
```{r}
abe <- c(NA,     NA)
cd	 <- c(Ddc_abe, NA)



upgma.mat4 <- rbind(abe,cd)
colnames(upgma.mat4) <- c("abe","cd")


```

## Finish up

The final entry of the matrix is 33.  This means that the distnace from the clade abe to the clade de is 33, with branch length of 33/2 = 16.5

The minimum distance
```{r}
dist.min.i <- min(upgma.mat4, na.rm = T)
```

The index value of the minimum
```{r}
index.min.i <- which(upgma.mat4 == dist.min.i, arr.ind =T)
index.row.i <- index.min.i[1]
index.col.i <- index.min.i[2]
```

We can get the names of our taxa using the 

```{r}
cluster.i2 <- rownames(upgma.mat4)[index.row.i]
cluster.i1 <- colnames(upgma.mat4)[index.col.i]
```


Add output to dataframe
```{r}
UPGMA_output[4,"clust.i"] <- cluster.i1
UPGMA_output[4,"clust.j"] <- cluster.i2
UPGMA_output[4,"dist.ij"] <- dist.min.i
```



### Combine species into clade

Combine the two taxa names into a new name.  This can be done a couple ways.
```{r}
clade.i <- paste(cluster.i1,cluster.i2, sep = "")
```

We'll add this to the dataframe

```{r}
UPGMA_output[4,"clust.u"] <- clade.i
```


### Calculate branch length

Branch length is distance/2 or d.ij/2
```{r}
UPGMA_output[4,"branch.l.ij"] <- UPGMA_output[4,"dist.ij"]/2
```



## Finalizing branch lengths

We now have a final tree structure.  In Newick format it would be

```{r}
library(ape)
full.tree <- "((c,d),(e,(b, a)));" # semi colon!
full.tree <-read.tree(text=full.tree)
plot(full.tree, main = "3-taxa tree")
```

While we've done our clustering we've calcualte branch lengths and put them in the column branch.l.ij of the dataframe UPGMA_output

```{r}
UPGMA_output
```

The following code adds them to the tree.  

First, the brnach lenghts from a to b

```{r}
plot(full.tree, main = "")
# a-b branch lengths= 8.5
text(x = 3.5,y = 5.1,labels = 8.5)
text(x = 3.5,y = 4.1,labels = 8.5)

```

now a to b, and ab to e

```{r}
plot(full.tree, main = "")
# a-b branch lengths= 8.5
text(x = 3.5,y = 5.1,labels = 8.5)
text(x = 3.5,y = 4.1,labels = 8.5)
# ab-e branch lengths= 1
text(x = 3.5,y = 3.1,labels = 11)
```

There's a branch between the clade ab and the node that connects with e.  What's its length?  FOr a simple ultrametric tree calcualted with UPGMA we can calculate this by subtraction

```{r}
11-8.5
```

We'll added this short branch of 2.5.  Note this things ARE NOT to scale.

```{r}
plot(full.tree, main = "")
# a-b branch lengths= 8.5
text(x = 3.5,y = 5.1,labels = 8.5)
text(x = 3.5,y = 4.1,labels = 8.5)
# ab-e branch lengths= 1
text(x = 3.5,y = 3.1,labels = 11)

# short branch
text(x = 2.5,y = 4.6,labels = 2.5)

```

To visualize exactly what is going on here its useful to add this

```{r}
par(mar = c(1,1,1,1))
plot(full.tree, main = "")
# a-b branch lengths= 8.5
text(x = 3.5,y = 4.9,labels = 8.5)
text(x = 3.5,y = 4.1,labels = 8.5)
# ab-e branch lengths= 1
text(x = 3.5,y = 3.1,labels = 11)

# short branch
text(x = 2.5,y = 4.6,labels = 2.5)

arrows(x0 = 2,x1 = 4,y0 =5.15,y1=5.15, code =3,angle = 90,length =0.1, lty =2, col = 2)
text(x = 2.5,y = 5,labels = "2.5+8.5=11")

```



We can now add the d-e branch of 14 (note again - not to scale!)

```{r}
plot(full.tree, main = "")
# a-b branch lengths= 8.5
text(x = 3.5,y = 5.1,labels = 8.5)
text(x = 3.5,y = 4.1,labels = 8.5)
# ab-e branch lengths= 1
text(x = 3.5,y = 3.1,labels = 11)

# short branch
text(x = 2.5,y = 4.6,labels = 2.5)

# d-e branch
text(x = 3.5,y = 1.1,labels = 14)
text(x = 3.5,y = 2.1,labels = 14)


```

The distance from abe to de is 16.5  We can visualize this as

```{r}
plot(full.tree, main = "")
# a-b branch lengths= 8.5
text(x = 3.5,y = 5.1,labels = 8.5)
text(x = 3.5,y = 4.1,labels = 8.5)
# ab-e branch lengths= 1
text(x = 3.5,y = 3.1,labels = 11)

# short branch
text(x = 2.5,y = 4.6,labels = 2.5)

# d-e branch
text(x = 3.5,y = 1.1,labels = 14)
text(x = 3.5,y = 2.1,labels = 14)


arrows(x0 = 0,x1 = 4,y0 =0.85,y1=0.85, code =3,angle = 90,length =0.1, lty =2, col = 2)
text(x = 1,y = 1,labels = 16.5)

```

We can calcualte the distance of the remaining short branch from de to the root as 16.5-14 = 2.5.  When we plot this again, it won't be to scale

```{r}
plot(full.tree, main = "")
# a-b branch lengths= 8.5
text(x = 3.5,y = 5.1,labels = 8.5)
text(x = 3.5,y = 4.1,labels = 8.5)
# ab-e branch lengths= 1
text(x = 3.5,y = 3.1,labels = 11)

# short branch
text(x = 2.5,y = 4.6,labels = 2.5)

# d-e branch
text(x = 3.5,y = 1.1,labels = 14)
text(x = 3.5,y = 2.1,labels = 14)


arrows(x0 = 0,x1 = 4,y0 =0.85,y1=0.85, code =3,angle = 90,length =0.1, lty =2, col = 2)
text(x = 1,y = 1,labels = "16.5 - 14 = 2.5")

```


We can calculate the remaining short branch from abe to the root as
16.5-8.5-2.5
=16.5-11
=5.5

```{r}
plot(full.tree, main = "")
# a-b branch lengths= 8.5
text(x = 3.5,y = 5.1,labels = 8.5)
text(x = 3.5,y = 4.1,labels = 8.5)
# ab-e branch lengths= 1
text(x = 3.5,y = 3.1,labels = 11)

# short branch
text(x = 2.5,y = 4.6,labels = 2.5)

# d-e branch
text(x = 3.5,y = 1.1,labels = 14)
text(x = 3.5,y = 2.1,labels = 14)


arrows(x0 = 0,x1 = 4,y0 =0.85,y1=0.85, code =3,angle = 90,length =0.1, lty =2, col = 2)
text(x = 1,y = 1,labels = "16.5 - 14 = 2.5")

arrows(x0 = 0,x1 = 4,y0 =5.1,y1=5.1, code =3,angle = 90,length =0.1, lty =2, col = 2)
text(x = 1,y = 5,labels = "16.5 - 8.5 - 2.5 = 5.5")

```

So the final tree has branch lengths (not to scale!) of

```{r}
plot(full.tree, main = "")
# a-b branch lengths= 8.5
text(x = 3.5,y = 5.1,labels = 8.5)
text(x = 3.5,y = 4.1,labels = 8.5)
# ab-e branch lengths= 1
text(x = 3.5,y = 3.1,labels = 11)

# short branch
text(x = 2.5,y = 4.6,labels = 2.5)

# d-e branch
text(x = 3.5,y = 1.1,labels = 14)
text(x = 3.5,y = 2.1,labels = 14)



text(x = 1,y = 1.6,labels = "2.5")


text(x = 1,y = 4,labels = "5.5")
```


Most of the time we don't include branch lengths in Newick format, but there is a way to do it. You don't need to know how to do this - this is just for illustration

```{r}
full.tree <- "((c:14,d:14):2.5,(e:11,(b:8.5, a:8.5):2.5):5.5);" # semi colon!
full.tree <-read.tree(text=full.tree)
plot(full.tree, main = "")

text(x = 10,y = 5.1,labels = 8.5)
text(x = 10,y = 4.1,labels = 8.5)
# ab-e branch lengths= 1
text(x = 10,y = 3.1,labels = 11)

# short branch
text(x = 7,y = 4.6,labels = 2.5)

# d-e branch
text(x = 10,y = 1.1,labels = 14)
text(x = 10,y = 2.1,labels = 14)



text(x = 1.5,y = 1.6,labels = "2.5")


text(x = 1.5,y = 3.9,labels = "5.5")
```


```{r}

```
