# Introduction

Comparative genomics is the field of bioinformatics that involves comparing the genomes of two different species, or of two different strains of the same species.

One of the first questions to ask when comparing the genomes of two species is: do the two species have the same number of genes (ie. the same gene content)? Since all life on earth shared a common ancestor at some point, any two species, for example, human and a fruitfly, must have descended from a common ancestor species.

Since the time of the common ancestor of two species (eg. of human and mouse), some of the genes that were present in the common ancestor species may have been lost from either of the two descendant lineages. Furthermore, the two descendant lineages may have gained genes that were not present in the common ancestor species.

# Using the biomaRt R Library to Query the Ensembl Database

To carry out comparative genomic analyses of two animal species whose genomes have been fully sequenced (eg. human and mouse), it is useful to analyze the data in the Ensembl database (www.ensembl.org).

The main Ensembl database which you can browse on the main Ensembl webpage contains genes from fully sequenced vertebrates, as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and a small number of additional model organism animals (eg. the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster).

There are also Ensembl databases for other groups of organisms, for example Ensembl Protists for Protists, Ensembl Metazoa for Metazoans, Ensembl Bacteria for Bacteria, Ensembl Plants for Plants, and Ensembl Fungi for Fungi.

It is possible to carry out analyses of the Ensembl database using R, with the “biomaRt” R package. The “biomaRt” package can connect to the Ensembl database, and perform queries on the data.

The “biomaRt” R package is part of the Bioconductor set of R packages, and so can be installed as explained here.

Once you have installed the “biomaRt” package, you can get a list of databases that can be queried using this package by typing:

```{r}
library("biomaRt") # Load the biomaRt package in R
listEnsemblGenomes()        # List all Ensembl genomes that can be queried


```

The names of the databases are listed, and the version of the database.

You will see that the “biomaRt” R package can actually be used to query many different databases including WormBase, UniProt, Ensembl, etc.

Here, we will discuss using the “biomaRt” package to query the Ensembl database, but it is worth remembering that it also be used to perform queries on other databases such as UniProt.

If you want to perform a query on the Ensembl database using “biomaRt”, you first need to specify that this is the database that you want to query. You can do this using the useEnsemblGenomes() function from the “biomaRt” package:
```{r}

ensemblprotists <- useEnsemblGenomes("protists_mart") # Specify that we want to query the Ensembl database

```

This tells “biomaRt” that you want to query the Ensembl Protists database. The Ensembl Protists database contains data sets of genomic information for different protist species whose genomes have been fully sequenced.

To see which data sets you can query in the database that you have selected (using useDataset()), you can type:
```{r}
listDatasets(ensemblprotists)
```

You will see a long list of the organisms for which the Ensembl Protists database has genome data, including Plasmodium falciparium (which causes malaria), and Leishmania major, which causes leishmaniasis, which is classified by the WHO as a neglected tropical disease.

To perform a query on the Ensembl database using the “biomaRt” R package, you first need to specify which Ensembl data set your query relates to. You can do this using the useDataset() function from the “biomaRt” package. For example, to specify that you want to perform a query on the Ensembl Leishmania major data set, you would type:
```{r}
ensemblleishmania <- useDataset("lmajor_eg_gene",mart=ensemblprotists)
```

Note that the name of the Leishmania major Ensembl data set is “lmajor_eg_gene”; this is the data set listed for Leishmania major genomic information when we typed listDatasets(ensemblprotists) above.

Once you have specified the particular Ensembl data set that you want to perform a query on, you can perform the query using the getBM() function from the “biomaRt” package.

Usually, you will want to perform a query to a particular set of features from the Leishmania major Ensembl data set. What types of features can you search for? You can find this out by using the listAttributes() function from the “biomaRt” package:
```{r}
leishmaniaattributes <- listAttributes(ensemblleishmania)
```

The listAttributes() function returns a list object, the first element of which is a vector of all possible features that you can select, and the second element of which is a vector containing explanations of all those features:
```{r}
attributenames <- leishmaniaattributes[[1]]
attributedescriptions <- leishmaniaattributes[[2]]
length(attributenames)        # Find the length of vector "attributenames"
attributenames[1:10]          # Print out the first 10 entries in vector "attributenames"
attributedescriptions[1:10]   # Print out the first 10 entries in vector "attributedescriptions"
```

This gives us a very long list of 630 features in the Leishmania major Ensembl data set that we can search for by querying the database, such as genes, transcripts (mRNAs), peptides (proteins), chromosomes, GO (Gene Ontology) terms, and so on.

When you are performing a query on the Ensembl Leishmania major data set using getBM(), you have to specify which of these features you want to retrieve. For example, you can see from the output of listAttributes() (see above) that one possible type of feature we can search for are Leishmania major genes. To retrieve a list of all Leishmania major genes from the Leishmania major Ensembl data set, we just need to type:
```{r}
leishmaniagenes <- getBM(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id"), mart=ensemblleishmania)
```

This returns a list variable leishmaniagenes, the first element of which is a vector containing the names of all Leishmania major genes. Thus, to find the number of genes, and print out the names of the first ten genes stored in the vector, we can type:
```{r}
leishmaniagenenames <- leishmaniagenes[[1]] # Get the vector of the names of all L. major genes
length(leishmaniagenenames)
leishmaniagenenames[1:10]
```

This tells us that there are 10300 different Leishmania major genes in the L. major Ensembl data set. Note that this includes various types of genes including protein-coding genes (both “known” and “novel” genes, where the “novel” genes are gene predictions that don’t have sequence similarity to any sequences in sequence databases), RNA genes, and pseudogenes.

What if we are only interested in protein-coding genes? If you look at the output of listAttributes(ensemblleishmania), you will see that one of the features is “gene_biotype”, which is tells us what sort of gene each gene is (eg. protein-coding, pseudogene, etc.):
```{r}
leishmaniagenes2 <- getBM(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "gene_biotype"), mart=ensemblleishmania)
```

In this case, the getBM() function will return a list variable leishmaniagenes2, the first element of which is a vector containing the names of all Leishmania major genes, and the second of which is a vector containing the types of those genes:
```{r}
leishmaniagenenames2 <- leishmaniagenes2[[1]] # Get the vector of the names of all L. major genes
leishmaniagenebiotypes2 <- leishmaniagenes2[[2]] # Get the vector of the biotypes of all genes
```

We can make a table of all the different types of genes using the table() function:
```{r}
table(leishmaniagenebiotypes2)
```

This tells us that there are 8315 protein-coding genes, 94 pseudogenes, and various types of RNA genes (tRNA genes, rRNA genes, snRNA genes, etc.). Thus, there are 8315 human protein-coding genes.



# Comparing the number of genes in two species
Ensembl is a very useful resource for comparing the gene content of different species. For example, one simple question that we can ask by analyzing the Ensembl data is: how many protein-coding genes are there in Leishmania major, and how many in Plasmodium falciparum?

We know how many protein-coding genes are in Leishmania major (8315; see above), but what about Plasmodium falciparum? To answer this question, we first need to tell the “biomaRt” package that we want to make a query on the Ensembl Plasmodium falciparum data set.

We can do this using the useDataset() function to select the Plasmodium falciparum Ensembl data set.
```{r}
ensemblpfalciparum <- useDataset("pfalciparum_eg_gene",mart=ensemblprotists)
```

Note that the name of the Plasmodium falciparum Ensembl data set is “pfalciparum_eg_gene”; this is the data set listed for Plasmodium falciparum genomic information when we typed listDatasets(ensemblprotists) above.

We can then use getBM() as above to retrieve the names of all Plasmodium falciparum protein-coding genes. This time we have to set the “mart” option in the getBM() function to “ensemblpfalciparum”, to specify that we want to query the Plasmodium falciparum Ensembl data set rather than the Leishmania major Ensembl data set:
```{r}
pfalciparumgenes <- getBM(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "gene_biotype"), mart=ensemblpfalciparum)
pfalciparumgenenames <- pfalciparumgenes[[1]] # Get the names of the P. falciparum genes
length(pfalciparumgenenames)                  # Get the number of P. falciparum genes

pfalciparumgenebiotypes <- pfalciparumgenes[[2]] # Get the types of the P. falciparum genes
table(pfalciparumgenebiotypes)
```

This tells us that there are 5767 Plasmodium falciparum protein-coding genes in Ensembl. That is, Plasmodium falciparum seems to have less protein-coding genes than Leishmania major (8315 protein-coding genes; see above).

It is interesting to ask: why does Plasmodium falciparum have less protein-coding genes than Leishmania major? There are several possible explanations: (i) that there have been gene duplications in the Leishmania major lineage since Leishmania and Plasmodium shared a common ancestor, which gave rise to new Leishmania major genes; (ii) that completely new genes (that are not related to any other Leishmania major gene) have arisen in the Leishmania major lineage since Leishmania and Plasmodium shared a common ancestor; or (iii) that there have been genes lost from the Plasmodium falciparum genome since Leishmania and Plasmodium shared a common ancestor.

To investigate which of these explanations is most likely to be correct, we need to figure out how the Leishmania major protein-coding genes are related to Plasmodium falciparum protein-coding genes.


# Identifying homologous genes between two species
The Ensembl database groups homologous (related) genes together into gene families. If a gene from Leishmania major and a gene from Plasmodium falciparum are related, they should be placed together into the same Ensembl gene family in the Ensembl Protists database. In fact, if a Leishmania major gene has any homologues (related genes) in other protists, it should be placed into some Ensembl gene family in the Ensembl Protists database.

For all Leishmania major and Plasmodium falciparum genes that are placed together in a gene family, Ensembl classifies the relationship between each pair of Leishmania major and Plasmodium falciparum genes as orthologues (related genes that shared a common ancestor in the ancestor of Leishmania and Plasmodium, and arose due to the Leishmania - Plasmodium speciation event) or paralogues (related genes that arose due to a duplication event within a species, for example, due to a duplication event in Leishmania major, or a duplication event in the Leishmania - Plasmodium ancestor).

If you type listAttributes(ensemblleishmania) again, you will see that one possible feature that you can search for is “pfalciparum_eg_homolog_ensembl_gene”, which is the Plasmodium falciparum orthologue of a Leishmania major gene.

Another possible feature that you can search for is “pfalciparum_eg_homology_orthology_type”, which describes the type of orthology relationship between a particular Leishmania major gene and its Plasmodium falciparum orthologue. For example, if a particular Leishmania major gene has two Plasmodium falciparum orthologues, the relationship between the Leishmania major gene and each of the Plasmodium falciparum orthologues will be “ortholog_one2many” (one-to-many orthology).

This can arise in the case where there was a duplication in the Plasmodium falciparum lineage after Plasmodium and Leishmania diverged, which means that two different Plasmodium falciparum genes (which are paralogues of each other) are both orthologues of the same Leishmania major gene.

Therefore, we can retrive the Ensembl identifiers of the Plasmodium falciparum orthologues of all Leishmania major genes by typing:
```{r}
leishmaniagenes <- getBM(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "pfalciparum_eg_homolog_ensembl_gene",
   "pfalciparum_eg_homolog_orthology_type"), mart=ensemblleishmania)
```

This will return an R list variable leishmaniagenes, the first element of which is a vector of Ensembl identifiers for all Leishmania major coding genes, and the second element of which is a vector of Ensembl identifiers for their Plasmodium falciparum orthologues, and the third element of which is a vector with information on the orthology types.

We can print out the names of the first 10 Leishmania major genes and their Plasmodium falciparum orthologues, and their orthology types, by typing:
```{r}
leishmaniagenenames <- leishmaniagenes[[1]]      # Get the names of all Leishmania major genes
leishmaniaPforthologues <- leishmaniagenes[[2]]  # Get the P. falciparum orthologues of all L. major genes
leishmaniaPforthologuetypes <- leishmaniagenes[[3]] # Get the orthology relationship type
leishmaniagenenames[1:10]

leishmaniaPforthologues[1:10]

leishmaniaPforthologuetypes[1:10]
```

Not all Leishmania major genes have Plasmodium falciparum orthologues; this is why when we print out the first 10 elements of the vector leishmaniaPforthologues, some of the elements are empty.

To find out how many Leishmania major genes have orthologues in Plasmodium falciparum, we can first find the indices of the elements of the vector leishmaniaPforthologues that are empty:
```{r}
myindex <- leishmaniaPforthologues==""
```

We can then find out the names of the Leishmania gene genes corresponding to those indices:
```{r}
leishmaniagenenames2 <- leishmaniagenenames[myindex]
length(leishmaniagenenames2)
```

This tells us that 8191 Leishmania major genes do not have Plasmodium falciparum orthologues.

How many of the 8191 Leishmania major genes that do not have Plasmodium falaciparum orthologues are protein-coding genes? To answer this question, we can merge together the information in the R list variable leishmaniagenes2 (which contains information on the name of each Leishmania major gene and its type; see above), and the R list variable leishmaniagenes (which contains information on the name of each L. major gene and its Plasmodium falciparum orthologues).

Remember that leishmaniagenes2 was created by typing:
```{r}
leishmaniagenes2 <- getBM(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "gene_biotype"), mart=ensemblleishmania)
```

To combine leishmaniagenes and leishmaniagenes2, we can use the merge() function in R, which can merge together two list variables that contain some named elements in common (in this case, both list variables contain a vector that has the names of Leishmania major genes):
```{r}
leishmaniagenes3 <- merge(leishmaniagenes2, leishmaniagenes)
```

The first element of the merged list variable leishmaniagenes3 contains a vector of the Leishmania major gene names, the second has a vector of the types of those genes (eg. protein-coding, pseudogene etc.), and the third element has a vector of the Plasmodium falciparum orthologues’ names. We can therefore find out how many protein-coding Leishmania major genes lack Plasmodium falciparum orthologues by typing:
```{r}
leishmaniagenenames <- leishmaniagenes3[[1]]
leishmaniagenebiotypes <- leishmaniagenes3[[2]]
leishmaniaPforthologues <- leishmaniagenes3[[3]]
myindex <- leishmaniaPforthologues=="" & leishmaniagenebiotypes=="protein_coding"
leishmaniagenenames2 <- leishmaniagenenames[myindex]
length(leishmaniagenenames2)
```

This tells us that there are 6476 Leishmania major protein-coding genes that lack Plasmodium falciparum orthologues.
