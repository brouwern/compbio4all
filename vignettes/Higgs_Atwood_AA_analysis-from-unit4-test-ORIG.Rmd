Add your name to "author" above

NOTE 1: When you submit this please remove all "TODO" prompts, NOTES, instructions.  etc by me. THe final product should look like a blog post, NOT a homework assignment

NOTE 2: Each code chunk should have a line that indicates what is being done, like an instructional blog post.


## Introduction

WRITING TODO: Write a 4-5 sentence introduce describing what is done by this script and why we care about it biologically.

## Preliminaries

### Packages

1. CODE-TODO: load ALL packages 
1. COMMENT-TODO: add a comment to indicate what each packages does
1. WRITING-TODO: describe in 1-2 sentences the relationship between ggpubr R and ggplot2.

```{r, echo = F}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(vegan)
library(scatterplot3d)
```


### Build the dataframe

1. CODE-TODO: build the amino acid dataframe I provided. 
1. WRITING-TODO: write 2-3 sentences about what the data represent.
1. TODO: read the comments I wrote in the code; you will want to refer to these later


These data are derived mostly from Higgs (2009) Table 1.  They are similar to Higgs and Attwood 2005 but have extra columns.  Nathan Brouwer added additional categorical varibles based on online information.

### Data prep

TODO: To make life easier, make a new version of your dataset which drops any categorical variables.  Call it aa_dat2

TODO: Write 1-2 sentences describing the approach you used to make this new dataframe.

```{r}
aa_dat2 <- aa_dat[,-c(1,

                      13,14,15,16,17)]
```


### Figure 7: Principal components analysis - base R

Run a PCA and create a PCA plot using base R command.

Plot the output 
```{r}
biplot(pca.out)
```
