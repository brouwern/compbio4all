`compbio4all` is a package of datasets and helpful functions for teaching bioinformatics and computational biology.  It in part draws on code originally published by Avril Coghlan as part of her Little book of R for bioinformatics: https://a-little-book-of-r-for-bioinformatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.  Functions and code from that book have been updated and placed in `compbio4all` for easy use.  I've also added various datasets and functions I've used in my own teaching.

## Installation

`compbio4all` is on GitHub.  If you don't already have it, you will need to install the `devtools` package

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

You can then install the `compbio4all` from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("brouwern/compbio4all")
```
